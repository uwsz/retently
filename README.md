# Retently Customer Experience Platform: Powerful AI-Driven Surveys, Seamless Integrations, 14-Day Free Trial

Your customers are talking, but are you really listening? Every day, businesses lose opportunities because they're either not collecting feedback or drowning in data they can't make sense of. The truth is, measuring customer satisfaction shouldn't feel like solving a puzzle. You need something that just works—something that helps you understand what your customers actually think without requiring a PhD in data science.

That's where customer experience platforms come in. And not all of them are created equal. Some make you jump through hoops. Others hit you with surprise costs. A few are so complicated that you need a dedicated team just to figure them out. But then there are platforms that get it right—tools that help you collect, analyze, and act on customer feedback without the headache.

Retently is one of those platforms that seems to have figured out the balance between power and simplicity. It's designed for businesses that want real insights, not just vanity metrics. Whether you're running an ecommerce store, a SaaS company, or a B2B service, understanding your customers' experience is no longer optional—it's survival.

## What Makes Retently Stand Out in the Customer Experience Space

Let's cut through the noise. Retently positions itself as a comprehensive customer experience management platform, and it delivers on multiple fronts. The platform specializes in three key metrics that matter: Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), and Customer Effort Score (CES). These aren't just buzzwords—they're the actual measurements that tell you whether customers will stick around or jump ship to your competitors.

What caught my attention is how Retently approaches survey campaigns. Unlike basic survey tools that just send out questionnaires and call it a day, Retently treats each campaign as a strategic operation. You can create independent campaigns for different products, services, or customer segments. Each campaign gets its own audience filters, scheduling options, alert settings, and automated follow-up emails. It's like having a dedicated feedback manager for every aspect of your business.

The platform works across multiple channels—email surveys, link surveys, embedded surveys on your website, in-app pop-ups, and even kiosk surveys for physical locations. This omnichannel approach means you're meeting customers where they already are, rather than forcing them to go somewhere specific to share their thoughts.

If you're ready to experience how sophisticated customer feedback collection can be without the complexity, 👉 [start your 14-day free trial with Retently](https://www.retently.com?fpr=li69) and see how it transforms your approach to customer experience. The platform offers full access during the trial period, so you can test every feature before committing a single dollar.

## Breaking Down the Pricing: Finding Your Perfect Fit

Pricing transparency matters. Nobody wants to invest time learning a platform only to discover hidden costs later. Retently keeps things straightforward with clear tier options that scale based on your business needs.

Here's how the pricing breaks down:

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price (10% Savings) | Best For | Key Features |
|------|---------------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Ecommerce Basic** | $49/month | $529/year | Small businesses and startups testing CX waters | NPS, CSAT, CES surveys; Email & link surveys; Knowledge base support; AI-powered sentiment analysis; Basic reporting & benchmarks |
| **Ecommerce Pro** | $299/month | $3,229/year | Growing ecommerce brands focused on scaling | Everything in Basic; Pro support (Zoom, live chat); Advanced reporting & trends; Data migration concierge; Priority support queue |
| **Enterprise** | Custom pricing | Custom pricing | Large organizations with complex needs | Everything in Pro; Dedicated account manager; Custom survey volumes; Dedicated onboarding; Data residency options; Priority features access |

What I appreciate about this structure is the 14-day free trial available across all plans—no credit card required. You're not locked into anything until you're convinced it's the right fit. The annual billing option saves you 10% right off the bat, which adds up when you're looking at the Pro tier or higher.

The Basic plan starts at a genuinely accessible price point. For $49 monthly, you're getting the core functionality that many competitors charge triple for. The Pro tier at $299 monthly adds the personalized support and advanced analytics that serious businesses need when customer feedback becomes central to their operations.

The platform's flexibility means you can start small and scale up as your feedback collection grows more sophisticated.

## The Technical Backbone: Features That Actually Matter

Features on a spec sheet mean nothing if they don't solve real problems. Retently packs in capabilities that address the actual pain points businesses face when trying to understand customer satisfaction.

**Smart Survey Design and Personalization**

The survey template editor gives you control over everything—colors, logos, fonts, button styles, text blocks, and custom links. But here's where it gets interesting: the open-ended questions and thank-you pages can be different for Promoters (9-10 scores), Passives (7-8 scores), and Detractors (0-6 scores). This means you can have a completely different conversation with someone who loves your product versus someone who's frustrated with it.

Merge fields allow personalization at scale. You can insert customer names, company names, account manager details, or any custom property into your survey. The system replaces these variables automatically before delivery, making each survey feel personally crafted rather than mass-produced.

**AI-Powered Feedback Analysis**

Here's where Retently separates itself from basic survey tools. The platform automatically analyzes text feedback using AI-powered sentiment analysis and topic classification. Instead of manually reading through hundreds of comments trying to find patterns, the system identifies themes and sentiment automatically. You can quickly see which aspects of your service are generating positive responses and which areas consistently frustrate customers.

**Campaign Intelligence**

The campaign structure is genuinely thoughtful. Each campaign includes audience segmentation, scheduling controls, alert configurations, and automated follow-up sequences. You can set daily survey limits to avoid overwhelming your team with feedback all at once. Surveys can be resent to people who didn't open or respond to the initial outreach, using either the same template or a different approach.

The Outbox feature provides granular tracking of every survey sent—when it was delivered, opened, responded to, or bounced. This data becomes invaluable for A/B testing different approaches and continuously improving your response rates.

**Integration Ecosystem**

Retently connects with the tools businesses actually use. Native integrations exist for HubSpot, Salesforce, Shopify, Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk, Pipedrive, and Segment. Beyond these direct connections, the platform integrates with over 7,000 applications through Zapier, Make, and Alloy automation platforms.

This means customer data flows bidirectionally. You can automatically import contacts from your CRM, trigger surveys based on specific customer actions in your ecommerce platform, and export feedback data back into your support ticketing system. The feedback loop becomes automated rather than requiring manual data shuffling between systems.

**Multi-Language Support**

Unlike platforms that force you into preset translations, Retently lets you fully customize survey text in any language. You're not stuck with generic translations that don't match your industry or brand voice. This matters enormously for businesses serving international markets or specific cultural communities within broader markets.

**Benchmark Comparisons**

The platform includes industry benchmark data built directly into the dashboard. You can compare your NPS scores against average scores in your industry without needing external research or paid benchmark reports. Currently, benchmarks exist for SaaS, ecommerce, financial services, enterprise software, digital marketing, consulting, insurance, healthcare, logistics, construction, and more.

Before choosing any customer experience platform, 👉 [see Retently's complete feature set in action](https://www.retently.com?fpr=li69) through their free trial. Understanding how these features work together makes all the difference between a tool that sits unused and one that becomes central to your customer strategy.

## Real Businesses, Real Results

Abstract features only matter if they translate into actual business outcomes. Retently's customer success stories demonstrate what's possible when feedback collection meets intelligent analysis.

SpearmintLOVE, an ecommerce children's apparel brand, achieved an NPS score of 79—significantly above the industry average—using Retently's systematic approach to gathering and acting on customer feedback. The clear overview of customer data helped them identify exactly what was working and what needed adjustment.

PensionBee, Jones Road Beauty, and Epic Gardening have all transformed their customer experience operations using Retently's platform. These aren't small operations—they're established brands serving substantial customer bases. The common thread is that they needed more than basic survey software; they needed a complete system for understanding and improving customer relationships.

The platform enables businesses to monitor satisfaction across every touchpoint—from initial purchase through product delivery, customer support interactions, and beyond. This journey mapping reveals which moments matter most to customer satisfaction and where problems typically emerge.

## The Automation Advantage

Manual processes don't scale. As your business grows, so does the volume of customer feedback. Retently automates the heavy lifting while keeping you in control of the strategy.

The platform can automatically send surveys triggered by specific customer actions—completing a purchase, receiving a product, closing a support ticket, or reaching a subscription milestone. These transactional surveys capture feedback when experiences are fresh in customers' minds, leading to more accurate and actionable responses.

Automated workflows can route feedback to appropriate team members based on score and content. Detractor feedback might automatically create a high-priority ticket in your support system, while Promoter responses could trigger requests for reviews or testimonials. Passive scores might initiate a follow-up sequence asking for more specific feedback about what would improve their experience.

Email cleanup happens automatically before surveys go out. The system checks email deliverability to reduce bounce rates and improve campaign performance. Antivirus detection prevents false responses from security systems that automatically click links in emails, keeping your data accurate.

## Data Segmentation and Export Freedom

One frustrating aspect of many platforms is data lock-in. They make it easy to get data in but difficult to get it out, especially in formats you can actually use. Retently takes the opposite approach.

Data segmentation is available in all plans, not just premium tiers. You can filter customers by any property—geography, product purchased, subscription level, lifetime value, or custom attributes specific to your business. Each campaign can target a specific segment, allowing for highly relevant survey questions and follow-up actions.

Exporting data is unrestricted across all plan levels. You own your data, and you can export users, feedback, scores, and trends whenever needed. There are no retention limits either—your data remains accessible as long as you maintain your subscription, allowing for longitudinal analysis and trend tracking over years.

The combination of flexible segmentation and open data access means Retently works alongside your existing analytics stack rather than trying to replace it. You can pull customer feedback into your business intelligence tools, correlate it with financial performance data, or combine it with product usage analytics.

## Support That Actually Helps

Platform capability means nothing if you can't get help when you need it. Retently's support structure scales with plan tiers, but even basic plans include responsive email support and comprehensive knowledge base documentation.

Pro plan subscribers get access to live chat support and Zoom consultations. Enterprise customers receive dedicated account managers who understand their specific use case and can provide strategic guidance beyond just technical support.

The platform's interface is intentionally designed to minimize the need for constant support. Menus are self-explanatory, data visualization is straightforward, and workflows are intuitive. Most users can start creating campaigns and analyzing feedback without extensive onboarding.

That said, when you do need help, the team operates around the clock. Customer reviews consistently highlight support quality as a primary reason for high satisfaction scores. It's not just about solving problems—it's about helping customers get maximum value from the platform.

## Making the Decision: Is Retently Right for Your Business?

Choosing a customer experience platform is not a decision to rush. The right tool becomes deeply integrated into how you understand and serve customers. The wrong choice means wasted time, incomplete data, and missed opportunities to improve.

Retently fits businesses that value comprehensive data over surface-level metrics. If you want to know not just what your NPS score is but why it is what it is and what to do about it, the platform delivers. The AI-powered analysis, flexible campaign structures, and automation capabilities support strategic decision-making rather than just generating reports.

The pricing structure accommodates different business stages. A startup can begin with the Basic plan and gain immediate value. A growing company can scale into Pro as feedback volume increases and support needs become more complex. Enterprise organizations get the customization and dedicated service appropriate for their scale.

For ecommerce businesses, the Shopify integration and transaction-triggered surveys are particularly valuable. B2B companies benefit from account-level tracking and CRM integrations. SaaS businesses appreciate the ability to tie feedback to specific product features or release cycles.

What Retently does not try to be is the cheapest option or the simplest checkbox survey tool. It's positioned for businesses that take customer experience seriously enough to invest in understanding it properly. The 14-day trial period exists specifically to let you determine if this strategic approach matches your needs before any financial commitment.

## Getting Started Without Risk

The barrier to trying Retently is deliberately low. The 14-day free trial requires no credit card, which means you can explore every feature without worrying about surprise charges if you forget to cancel. This isn't a limited trial with key features locked—you get full access to test the platform in your actual business context.

Setting up your first campaign takes minutes rather than hours. The template editor includes defaults that work well for most businesses, but you can customize everything if you want specific branding or messaging. Importing customers can happen via CSV file, direct integration with your CRM or ecommerce platform, or through the API for custom implementations.

The learning curve is manageable because the interface follows logical workflows. Creating a campaign walks you through template selection, audience definition, scheduling, and automation options in a clear sequence. The dashboard provides immediate visibility into response rates, score distributions, and feedback trends.

During the trial period, you're not alone. The support team helps with setup questions, integration challenges, or strategy considerations. Many businesses discover optimization opportunities they hadn't considered just by talking through their feedback collection goals with someone who understands the platform's capabilities.

If you're ready to move beyond guessing what customers think and start operating with data-driven certainty, 👉 [begin your Retently free trial today](https://www.retently.com?fpr=li69) and experience the difference between collecting feedback and actually understanding your customers. The insights you gain in the first two weeks often justify the entire annual investment.

## The Bottom Line on Customer Experience Intelligence

Customer experience isn't a department or a project—it's the entire reason businesses exist. Every interaction shapes whether customers stay loyal or look elsewhere. Every frustration that goes unaddressed is an opportunity handed to your competitors. Every positive experience that you don't understand is a success you can't replicate.

Retently provides the infrastructure to systematically capture, analyze, and act on customer feedback across every touchpoint in your business. The platform combines survey delivery, AI-powered analysis, automation, and integrations into a cohesive system rather than requiring you to stitch together multiple tools.

The pricing is transparent and scales with your business. The features address real operational needs rather than checking boxes on a comparison chart. The support team helps you succeed rather than just answering technical questions. And the free trial removes any risk from testing whether this approach fits your specific situation.

At the end of the day, you have two choices: operate with assumptions about what customers think, or invest in actually knowing. Retently makes the second option not just possible but practical. The question isn't whether customer feedback matters—you already know it does. The question is whether you're collecting and using it effectively enough to drive the improvements that keep customers coming back.

For businesses serious about customer experience as a competitive advantage, 👉 [explore what Retently can do for your organization](https://www.retently.com?fpr=li69) starting with a risk-free trial. The insights waiting in your customers' feedback might be exactly what your business needs to reach the next level of growth and loyalty.
